				<h2 class="aligncenter">Jason Caplan wants the world to speak music.</h2>
					<p>
					Jason Caplan knew music was going to be a life-long companion from an early age. His grandmother said at preschool he went straight for the xylophone. Jason soon graduated from percussion to strings. “My dad got me started on violin—it didn’t win me friends or girlfriends so I picked up the guitar.” 
					</p>
					<p>
					Jason loved all music but he had an affinity for jazz, especially legends like John Coltrane and Charlie Parker. “My guitar teacher gave me a tape of Charlie Parker. I can still listen to Charlie Parker like it’s the first time I’ve heard him. I was young, but what he was saying rang so true. I got exactly what Coltrane was talking about. That it made a huge impression.” 

					</p>
					<p>
					Jason also knew faith was going to be a life-long companion.  His rich Jewish heritage to this day provides a daily compass and source of happiness.  It’s also what propelled him to be a seeker of meaning and truth.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Manhattan, New York 2004</h4>
					
					<p>
					Jason Caplan left Emory University in Atlanta to embark on a quest of sorts. He’d been diligently studying the Torah, yet he felt a void. He felt like an observer. He wanted more. He wanted to be an active participant in his faith. This led him to Yeshiva University in Manhattan where he met musicians from around the world. “Manhattan is an entire world, with the next nation just a subway ride away.”  
					</p>
					<!--
					<p>
					<i>PIC CAPTION: Jason Caplan in Manhattan 2004 standing in front of John Coltrane’s Love Supreme album, one of the greatest jazz albums of all time and part of the collection in the Smithsonian Institute.</i>
					</p>
					<-->
					<p>
					The next music legend was just a subway ride away too.  Jason would frequent the clubs and performance spaces that featured his jazz heroes, such as Andy Statman, John Zorn, Kenny Werner, and Dave Liebman.  These jazz legends were more than happy to talk shop and with a little encouragement, even play a few gigs in Jason’s Washington Heights neighborhood. “I’d go see these guys all the time. They were so amazing I had to sit on my hands to keep from jumping up on the stage with them. I knew they were in a different league, but I wanted to be up there with them anyway. I thought, wouldn’t it be great if I could?”  This notion of being able to play with musicians “just like that” captivated Jason. The desire to be participant in both music and in faith fueled Jason’s vision to create such a world. 
					</p>
					<p>
					New York City also provided a rich cultural landscape for Jason’s quest, which eventually led him to a Sikh center in Queens.  There he experienced a remarkable catalyst that helped shape his vision. A vision of a place where all people can congregate and communicate freely.
					</p>
					<p>
					While in the temple, meditating on their beautiful music, Jason met Dr. Harsimran Singh with whom he shared his views on religion. “I think religion has some major challenges,” Jason said.  Dr. Singh agreed, and then invited Jason to sing in a Sikh Temple saying, “You don’t have to be Sikh and I don’t need to be Jewish. We just sing.” 
					</p>
					<p>
					So Jason found himself in a Sikh Temple singing in front of the entire congregation. He studied enough Punjabi to sing the Sikh Holy Songs, with his colleagues, William Ruiz and Gilbert Smith.   “I didn’t know their prayers, I didn’t practice their faith, yet I was still invited to sing in a Sikh Temple.” This was real a-ha moment for Jason. “My friendship with Dr. Singh is very profound.  Here is this very devout person who had no interest in converting me at all, perfectly happy to let our faiths co-exist. It was eye opening. That’s when I started to think, wouldn’t it be great if this kind of collaboration could happen anywhere?” 
					</p>
					<p>
					And just as singing in the Sikh Temple connected him with those of another faith, so too can using the power of music to bring people together. And there in the middle of a deep love for music and a deep philosophical curiosity the idea for the Universal Room was born.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Richmond, Virginia 2014</h4>
					
					<p>
					Today, Jason Caplan is still in love with jazz. He’s a man of faith who is ready to launch a beautiful synthesis of both his passions. 
					</p>
					<p>
					The Universal Room is an experience open to anyone interested in communication through improvisational music. The Universal Room brings people together with one common denominator:  music. By eliminating the idea of an audience and embracing participation, people can connect with others that share their particular music interest, from bluegrass to classical to folk to Ska. When you speak music you can communicate with anyone.
					</p>
					<p>
					People meet and connect in the Universal Room, gathering anywhere, from coffee shops to city parks. The beauty is that there are no boundaries. No walls. No doors. 
					</p>
					<p>
					The Universal Room not only brings people together through music it serves as a valuable network for musicians looking to bring their talents to communities around the world. Through The Universal Room, Jason shows musicians how to bring out the best of their ideas, interact with a group, and communicate with music.  “There’s gold in the hills of America and all over the world. The Universal Room is one way to mine that gold and share the wealth with everyone. I want people to listen to those classic jazz albums again and breathe life back into music on the verge of being lost.” The Universal room gives musicians a way share their talents and keep the purity of their craft alive. 
					</p>
					<p>
					The ending of Jason’s decade-long journey is also a beginning––the start of something exceptionally unique that’s open to everyone. The Universal Room is freedom from conventional language. As Jason puts it, “when you speak music, everyone’s on the same page.”
					</p>
					<p>
					It’s time to Speak music.
