				<h1 class="abt-tit aligncenter post p4" style="margin-bottom:0px;">The Sound of RAIN</h1>
				<h2 class="aligncenter">Robin Davis.</h2>
					<p dir="ltr">
    Robin Davis is a force of nature. And, she has a mission: to enhance the social and spiritual health of individuals with Autism through creative outlets
    designed to help them build relationships and express themselves freely. Robin is making it happen.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Born and raised in Bon Air, Virginia, Robin is single mom of three: Matthew (14), Emma (10), and Bryan (30). She’s founder and Executive Director of RAIN
    (Richmond Autism Integration Network. RAIN offers year-round creative and social programs for children on the spectrum from ages eight to 18 in the Greater
    Richmond area.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Prior to starting RAIN in 2012, Robin was the Admissions and Marketing Director for Sitter and Barfoot Veterans Care Center, which is owned and operated by
    the Virginia Department of Veterans Services. Robin helped open SBVCC and has an extensive background in Marketing and Sales. Well on her way to the top,
    Robin stepped away from her career. It came at a cost, but it was worth the price.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Robin graciously shared her story with me–– her inspiration, the perspiration and the revelation of creating something truly meaningful and how Jason
    Caplan and his concept of The Universal Room has impacted her journey.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    What inspired you to start RAIN?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    My 14-year old autistic son, Matthew. I knew once my son was in fourth grade and it was time to transition to middle school that the traditional
    educational path just wasn’t going to work for him. School was tough for him. So, I left my job, gave up my house, prayed a lot and started home schooling
    him. But, I knew he needed more. He needed other kids. That’s when I started a summer camp for autistic kids that provided creative outlets like art and
    music. The first summer we had 8 kids. The next summer we had 28. Then this past summer we had 222. Seems like every bump we could hit we hit. But I
    refused to quit. I just kept pushing forward. And, since that first summer, RAIN continues to grow with year-round programs and networking opportunities.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    How did you meet Jason Caplan?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    Jason sort of found me. About four years ago when I just started getting RAIN up and running, I posted openings for a Board of Directors. I was looking for
    solid business advice and guidance. A friend told Jason about it and contacted me. The rest is sort of history. I met Jason for coffee and we hit it off
    immediately. He told me he loved what I was doing and that he wanted to help. We talked about music. We talked about art. We shared our visions and
    thoughts about creativity. This all got us talking about starting a music program. Everything just unfolded from there. Jason came in and did a music
    program for the kids. He brought a lot instruments, some I’d never even seen before. The kids loved it. I knew at that moment, music therapy needed to be a
    part of RAIN. Jason helped me pull that together. It’s been a wonderful partnership.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<h4>
    What’s a music session with Jason or one of his Universal Room facilitators like?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    We call it Talking with Music. Joe Lubman is one of Jason’s facilitators who has set up and guided lots of sessions for us. He didn’t just come in and dump
    a bunch of instruments on the floor. He talked to the kids about music and how different sounds can mimic your emotions. He showed videos about different
    kinds of music from all over the world. And, of course they create music. It’s a wonderful eclectic mix of communication and the kids respond so positively
    to it. One time Joe helped them write and create a camp song. They loved that.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    How has using music and Jason’s facilitators impacted the kids?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    Some kids are non-verbal and have problems processing sensory stimuli. Music helps them pull everything together. Everybody feels like a part of something.
    No one feels left out. The Universal Room way of sharing music is free flowing. It’s not formal instruction. It’s exploration and expression. And, because
    there is no wrong way to do it everybody participates. They may start off super quiet and not participating, but by the time it’s over they are really
    getting into it and having a great time. This is really a big deal for the parents. They’re used to their kids not interacting. That’s why I make sure to
    take a lot of photos. Because when I can show a parent a photo of their child participating and playing an instrument it’s a moment that matters really.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    What would you like to see the The Universal Room concept become in the future?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    I’ve seen first hand the benefits music can have on children with autism. I’d love to see this form of therapy embraced by other schools and camps that
    work with children on the spectrum. We just need to get the word out. Jason Caplan and his team of facilitators have made a positive impact on the children
    of RAIN, it’s time others benefitted too.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I’m launching a new program called Social Saturdays and Jason and Joe will be bringing the universal language of music.
