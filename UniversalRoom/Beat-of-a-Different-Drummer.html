				<h1 class="abt-tit aligncenter post p4" style="margin-bottom:0px;">Beat of a Different Drummer</h1>
				<h2 class="aligncenter">William Ruiz.</h2>
					<p dir="ltr">
    William Ruiz’s music is a mesmerizing blend of African, Native American, and Asian sounds. His music has been described as serene, minimalist, rhythmic,
    and meditational. But, he cut his teeth on rock and roll, heavy metal and punk. This is a drummer who has explored every nook and cranny of his craft.
    While exploring different genres and techniques, one thing has remained constant––his appreciation of the listener. William’s genuine desire to connect and
    communicate through his music has always been his north.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    William’s main instrument is the tongue drum/Log drum and the Mayohuacan of Native American/Taino Indian origin. His deep passion for music is evident in a
    diverse history including headlining events at Madison Square Garden and being featured on the MSG Channel TV Series NYC Soundtracks. William has performed
    at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center Outdoors, the United Nations, and CNN. He has performed live on Hot 97, WBAI 99.5 - NYC radio and for Kofi Annan,
    Mayor Bloomberg and Tavis Smiley as well as for the International Health Coalition. William has performed, recorded, and worked with world renowned
    musicians such as Reggie Workman, William Cepeda, Victor Bailey, J.T. Lewis, Yossi Fine, Jay Rodriguez, Abdou Mboup, Sam Newsome, Joe Exley, Jojo Kuo, Josh
    Roseman, Groove Collective, Osunlade, and Uli Geissandorfer to name a few.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Whew. Quite impressive. You’d think some level of ego would accompany such an accomplished artist. However, our interview revealed a refreshingly down to
    earth, humble guy with an incredibly infectious enthusiasm for his art. Our conversation went like this:
</p>
<h4>
    How did you meet Jason?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    I met Jason over ten years ago on the A train platform in New York City. I was playing music on the street. Just doing my thing. Jason came up to me, said
    he liked my music. The next thing I knew I was playing alongside Jason in his band Naqshon’s Leap.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    What got you into music?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    I was 10 years old when I started drumming. My cousin turned me on to it. Drumming came easy to me. I never studied formally. I grew up playing rock and
    roll, heavy metal, a little punk. There was a point when I started getting into different styles like bebop and abstract jazz, which also turned me on to
    all kinds of percussion instruments.
</p>
<br/>
<ph4>
    Name one big influencer in your music.
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
Ray Brown is a famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz">jazz</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bassist">double bassist</a> and    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellist">cellist</a>. He has a theory that jazz musicians started losing their audience base when they abandoned
    their dance style beats and rhythms for more complicated, cerebral stuff. Basically they stopped playing what people liked and played what they liked. They
    forgot their audience. You can never do that.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Taking a cue from Ray Brown, I wanted to get more syncopated with my music, with more rhythm and playing off the beat. A drum set is a very academic
    approach to percussion. It’s very technical and number oriented. So I decided to pick up more unusual instruments like the tongue drum that would provide a
    more pure and simple beat.
</p>
<br/>
<ph4>
    What is your particular philosophy about music?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    That it should be easy to get. Not over engineered. Digestible. Attainable.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I learned from playing in the street that music needs a beat. You need to tap into people’s frequency—which is a dance based frequency. And I found that
    the best way to communicate that beat is through cultural and spiritual based music with African, Asian, Indonesian and Native American influences. I like
    to extract orthodox music and repurpose it to be more mainstream. If you have to think about it too much or it’s too hard to get, people naturally just
    check out. If you want people to not just hear, but listen, you need to keep it simple.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    How does your philosophy of making unorthodox music more attainable to everyone fit into the Universal Room concept?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    It a natural fit. The Universal Room is all about simplicity and unity. Jason’s genius is his ability to create a common ground for everyone. That’s my
    main goal when I play too. I make sure I’m reachable and attainable or it doesn’t work. If you appreciate what I’m doing, I’m thankful, it inspires me to
    continue what I’m doing and be a great player. That’s the Universal Room way too. Participants are appreciated and valued. They are the Universal Room.
</p>
<br/>
<ph4>
    Have you experienced anyone having a musical epiphany at a Universal Room gathering?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    I have. What’s great about the Universal Room concept is no matter where you’re from, what culture you are, what your musical background is, you fit in.
    The Universal Room is all about breaking down barriers––whether they’re cultural, spiritual, economical, or even physical.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I’ve seen a construction worker walk in all stiff and nervous and then after a session with Jason, he left a more relaxed and happy guy. Music does that.
    And in an environment like the Universal Room where judgment is non-existent, performance anxiety is non-existent. Another time when I was in Richmond, I
    watched a whole group of young girls go from being almost paralyzed with fear into laughing, musical participants. It was cool. Seeing that transformation
    in people is really something.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    Do people have to have musical ability to be a part of a Universal Room gathering?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    Absolutely not. You don’t have to be qualified. You don’t have to play an instrument. A session isn’t for you to train and learn, it’s for you to try
    something new and meet new people. You may play the piano and decide you want to pick up the tongue drum. Or, you may not play anything and end up playing
    everything.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    There’s nothing imposing or intimidating about it. You lose a crowd with over instruction. Jason doesn’t do that. It’s nothing like a one-dimensional drum
    circle where you follow a leader. It’s a multi-instrument environment that’s free flowing and low key. Participants are the teachers, performers and
    audience all at once.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    You also get the opportunity to study with professionals that aren’t after your money. Jason will bring in professional musicians showcasing drums,
    harmonium, acoustic bass––you name it. You get the real value of teaching that isn’t constrained by time or money.
</p>
<br/>
<h4>
    What would you like the future to hold for the Universal Room?
</h4>
<p dir="ltr">
    I’d like to see it become a franchise. I’d love to see a Universal Room in every state and country. You can do other things out of a Universal Room like
    dance and yoga, but it starts with creating an environment. If anyone can make this happen it’s Jason. I’m just honored to be a part of his journey and to
    help in any way I can.
