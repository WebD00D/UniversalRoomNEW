				<h2 class="aligncenter">Matt Baranello</h2>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>Matt Baranello is a musician. I’ll say it again, Matt Baranello is a musician. He's never done the 9 to 5 thing. Never navigated the political gauntlet of corporate America. Never went through line items in a power point presentation to get "buy-in." He did the remarkable, the almost unthinkable. For the past 20 years Matt Baranello has made a living and supported a family through music. A rarity in these competitive times where Darwinian Fitness makes animals out of even the most composed. 
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>It all started when Matt was told what he couldn’t do. He was nine years old and wanted to play the saxophone. But there was a problem. He had asthma. His music teacher suggested drums would be better. And, the teacher nailed it. It was love at first beat. Matt has been a professional drummer and percussionist ever since. 
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>Matt  received his Bachelors of Music in Jazz Performance from the Manhattan School of Music in 1999. He’s equally fluent in Jazz, Afro-Latin, and American popular styles. He also plays Bata, Congas, and Timbales and has shared the stage with numerous Jazz, R&B, and Afro-Caribbean legends.  His dossier is long and impressive, but some highlights include drumming for Ensemble Uniqua, Piltdown Man, and Bryan Vargas and ¡Ya Esta!. He has performed live and/or recorded with Max “the Sax” Lucas, Alyson Williams, The Flamingos, Eartha Kitt, The Drifters, Maristella, Ronny Jordan, Kema Jamal, Benoir, Tim Berne, Eric Johnson, Jimmy McGriff, Fred McFarlane, Carlos ” Go-Go” Gomez, Seleno Clarke, and many others. 
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>In addition, Matt has toured the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Germany with various musical groups. He can be heard on countless recordings featuring a wide variety of musical styles such as Jazz, Heavy Metal, Afro-Cuban folkloric, Afro-Latino Soul, R&B, Hip-Hop, Rock, and Folk. There isn’t a genre he hasn’t touched. 
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>When I spoke with Matt, it was clear why being a working musician has worked for him. He gets it. And, it gets him. He sees music as multi-dimensional, not just something to perform, but an art form to learn, share, teach, and cultivate. And, like his friend and fellow musician Jason Caplan of the Universal Language Room, he pays it forward. Or, in the case of musicians “plays” it forward.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p><b>Who influenced your growth as a musician?</b>
	</p>
	<p>I’ve had a lot of great teachers. I started with Billy Warren and Randy Knudsen, two local drum teachers who really helped me get started. When I was 15 I hooked up with Dom Famularo who helped me take things to a higher level in my training as a professional musician. He typically only taught professional musicians, but I think he took me in because I knew who he was. That was a really big break for me to learn from one of the best. I then studied under Al Miller and John Riley. When I was 18 I had to good fortune to learn from Ralph Peterson, a jazz hero of mine.   A guy who was a huge mentor and teacher for me, not only professionally but spiritually as well was Carlos “Go-Go” Gomez. He really tied everything together for me. I studied Bata drums with him. These drums are sacred and are used in Afro-Cuban ceremonies. In 1999, I was initiated to the Omo Aña Bata drum society by Carlos Gomez. This was a huge honor and had a big impact on me. 
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p><b>What is your particular philosophy of the power of music?</b>  
	</p>
	<p>I think being a musician comes with a certain level of responsibility. It’s not enough to just entertain, you need to collaborate and educate. One of my biggest influences is Indian Sufi master, Hazrat Inayat Khan. He wrote a wonderful book called 
		Mysticism of Sound and Music. His philosophy is much in line with the Universal Language Room concept. That music is an expression of the overwhelming and perfect harmony of the whole universe—and that’s the secret of its amazing power to move us. Music is one of the purest forms of religion. And, musicians have a duty to share it. <br><br>I’m also constantly learning. It’s an ongoing process. I’ve never been of the mindset that I’ve got it all down. What’s encouraging is that you see a heightened level of engagement in new metal bands like Periphery and Animals as Leaders. These guys do more than just tour and perform, they teach as well. They’re not like the bands of the 80s and 90s that were god like figures you had no access to. These new bands interact with their fan base on much more meaningful level. It’s a natural evolution happening with modern musicians and I hope to see it continue.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p><b>How did you meet Jason Caplan?</b>
	</p>
	<p>I first met Jason over eight years ago while playing at the Lenox Lounge in Harlem with the Nate Lucas Group. I’d been playing with this band for the past 16 years. Nate is a legendary organist in the Harlem jazz scene and Jason would sit in with us from time to time. Then as luck would have it, I was referred by a fellow musician to fill an opening Jason had for a teacher at his music school Intonation. And, we’ve been friends ever since.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>What is your perspective of the Universal Language Room?<br>It’s an opportunity for a lot of people get together and bond, especially those who have differences. Jason has structured it such a way that it’s truly neutral ground. And, this is great for breaking down barriers and widening circles. I think it’s especially relevant now as we are living in times where people are becoming increasingly isolated. Technology and social media have a place but it’s really an artificial form of interaction. The Universal Language Room brings people together and helps them form authentic relationships that are based on real human interaction. I think people are really hungry for that. 
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p><b>Do you use the Universal Language Room philosophy in your own work?</b>
	</p>
	<p>Absolutely. Music really does heal. I was once an artist in residence working with at risk 15 to 21 year olds. These were kids who were looking for something. I’ve witnessed several life changing moments with these kids. I remember there was this kid who couldn’t hear. I put a balloon on an amp so he could feel the music. It was like a light came on. His mood and outlook changed. Just from that one thing. We take it for granted when we can hear, and showing him how to “hear” music by feeling it was pretty groundbreaking for him. I saw a lot of these kids really take to music and run with it. It was definitely the Universal Language Room philosophy in action. 
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p><b>What would you like to see the Universal Language Room become?</b>
	</p>
	<p>Because music is such a natural and effective communicator, I’d like to see Jason use his band Naqshon’s Leap as a doorway to introduce people to his concept. As a working band, it’s perfect for growing the Universal Language Room. Jason has such an interactive of playing anyway, so it’s a natural segue into the Universal Language Room. Really, the bigger his band gets, the larger the positive influence of the Universal Language Room becomes. 
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>Currently, Matt is based in South Orange, New Jersey. He’s a member of Coincidence Machine, The Nate Lucas All-Stars, and leads various ensembles of his own. He’s also signed to AJB Productions. He’s available for gigs, touring and recording sessions. In addition, he offers audio production services and private instruction out of his home studio both in studio and via the internet (iChat, Skype). Check out
